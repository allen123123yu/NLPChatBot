NLP Chatbot Project

This is a chatbot built for 911 to use for home emergencies. It covers first aid, police, and firefighter issues.

To run the code, run, or enter "chatca()"

Challenges:
Not messing up the JSON file while editing
Setting up clear goals; it's easy to get carried away
Opening too many notebooks = turbo jet

Next steps:
Include more layers, and/or splitting the big chatbot into more segments
Figure out import process call function
