# NLPChatBot
NLP Chatbot Project

This is a chatbot built for 911 to use for home emergencies. It covers first aid, police, and firefighter issues.

1. Download 911 SA.py 
2. faintents.json
3. pointents.json
4. ffintentsmids.json 
5. change file directory/open
6. To run the code, run, or enter "chatsa()" after breaking.


Challenges:




Not messing up the JSON file while editing

Setting up clear goals; it's easy to get carried away

Opening too many notebooks = turbo jet

Couldn't find good datasets for police and firefighter.



Next steps:

Include more layers, and/or splitting the big chatbot into more segments, and branch out to include non-home emergencies like traffic etc

Find or collect more data
